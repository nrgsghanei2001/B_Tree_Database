B-Tree Database

This project entails the development of a robust database system employing B-tree data structures. Each field within the database is represented by a B-tree, capable of efficiently storing large volumes of data. The system offers essential functionalities including insertion, deletion, updating, searching, and data selection.

The implementation is entirely realized in C++ programming language, ensuring high performance and versatility. To facilitate seamless interaction, regular expressions are employed to translate user commands into database operations. Moreover, the system employs various hashing techniques tailored to different data types, such as strings, numeric values, and dates, optimizing data storage and retrieval processes.
