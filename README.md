# B-Tree Database

## Project Overview

This project is the final assignment for my Data Structures course, focused on implementing a database system using the B-Tree data structure. The project demonstrates the efficient handling and manipulation of large datasets by the capabilities of B-Trees for various database operations.

## Features

- **B-Tree Implementation:**
  - Each database field is managed using a B-Tree, allowing efficient storage, retrieval, and management of large data volumes.
  - Supports key database operations, including insertion, deletion, updating, searching, and data selection.

- **C++ Implementation:**
  - The entire system is implemented in C++.

- **Command Interface:**
  - User commands are translated into database operations using regular expressions, enabling intuitive and seamless interaction with the database.

- **Optimized Data Handling:**
  - The system employs various hashing techniques for specific data types (e.g., strings, numeric values, dates).
